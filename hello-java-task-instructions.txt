===== Hello Java =====
In this exercise you will practice some Java usage basics and create a multi-stage build.

hello-java is a simple program that writes to the console.
In order to build it you will need the maven build tool and the Java Development Kit version 8 (JDK8). The official maven docker image has both.
In order to execute it you will only need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Note that this specific program insists on running in a clean JRE 8, and will complain if run in JDK.

Some of the commands you will use:
[a] To build: mvn verify
    The resulting application is found in "target" as "hello-java.jar"
[b] To run: java -jar hello-java.jar

Tasks:
Part I - Manual stuff
(1) Pull a maven docker image and manually build the application
(2) Manually run the application
(3) If you did not get full points - fix what you did wrong, until you do.

Part II - Dockerfile
(4) Build the application using maven image and a volume
(5) Create a Dockerfile that include the application and runs it as the entrypoint

Part III - Multi-stage
(6) Create a multi-stage Dockerfile that 
(a) builds the application based on COPY of sources
(b) creates an image which includes the app as it's entry point
